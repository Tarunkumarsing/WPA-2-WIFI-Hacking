# WPA2 WiFi Hacking Project

## Introduction
This project aims to demonstrate the process of hacking WPA2 WiFi networks by exploiting the 4-way handshake mechanism. It's an educational tool designed to understand the vulnerabilities within the WPA2 protocol and to promote better security practices.

### Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized hacking into WiFi networks is illegal and unethical. The creator of this project does not endorse illegal activities and urges users to ensure they have explicit permission to test networks.

## Background
The WPA2 security protocol is widely used for protecting WiFi networks. However, it's vulnerable to certain types of attacks. One such vulnerability involves the 4-way handshake process, which is crucial for establishing a secure connection between a client and an access point (AP). Understanding this process is key to comprehending how WPA2 networks can be compromised.

### Key Concepts
- **PMK (Pairwise Master Key):** Derived from the pre-shared key (PSK), this is a 256-bit string used in the handshake process.
- **PTK (Pairwise Transit Key):** Used for encrypting unicast traffic between the client and the AP.
- **GTK (Group Temporal Key):** Used for encrypting broadcast and multicast traffic.
- **ANONCE & SNONCE:** Random numbers generated by the AP and client, respectively, used in the creation of the PTK.
- **MIC (Message Integrity Code):** A signature used to verify the integrity of messages.

### The 4-Way Handshake
1. **Message 1:** AP sends ANONCE to the client.
2. **Message 2:** Client responds with SNONCE and a MIC.
3. **Message 3:** AP sends the GTK to the client.
4. **Message 4:** Client acknowledges the successful reception and installation of the GTK.

Understanding these stages is crucial for attempting to crack the WiFi password, as capturing the handshake allows for the PMK to be guessed through various methods.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Network Analyzer:** For capturing EAPOL packets which contain the handshake.
- **Wireshark:** For seeing EAPOL packets.
- **Visual Studio:** For running a code.

## Setup and Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Project:** First, download the entire folder containing the project files.
2. **Open in Visual Studio:** Navigate to the downloaded folder and open it in Visual Studio.
3. **Install Pyshark:** Check if the Pyshark library is installed on your system. If not, you can install it by running `pip install pyshark` in your terminal or command prompt.
4. **Generate a Password Dictionary:** Use the provided `passphrase.py` script to generate a dictionary of passwords. This script will output a `password.txt` file, which will be used by the main script to attempt password cracking.

## Capturing EAPOL Packets
To capture the necessary EAPOL packets, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Prepare for Monitoring
1. Disconnect from all wireless networks.
2. Open a Terminal and enter `airmon-ng`. This command will list all wireless cards that support monitor mode.
3. If your wireless card is listed, enable monitor mode by typing `airmon-ng start <interface name>`. Replace `<interface name>` with the name of your wireless card (e.g., `wlan0`).

### Step 2: Use Microsoft Network Analyzer
1. With monitor mode enabled, run the Microsoft Network Analyzer tool to capture EAPOL packets. These packets are generated when devices attempt to connect to the targeted WiFi network and contain the information needed to crack the password.
2. Look for the four EAPOL messages (Message 1, Message 2, Message 3, Message 4). The critical information is in the EAPOL Message 2.
3. Open the captured Message 2 packet in Wireshark and extract the following details:
   - SSID
   - APmac (WiFi MAC address)
   - Clientmac
   - ANONCE
   - SNONCE
   - Data

### Step 3: Running the Script
1. Input the details extracted from the EAPOL Message 2 into the provided script.
2. Run the script. If successful, it will output the password for the targeted WiFi network.
